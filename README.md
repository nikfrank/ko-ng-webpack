# ko-ng-webpack

to start::

```
npm i -g ko-gen # if you haven't already

cd ~/code
npm init #just hit enter a bunch of times
npm i ko-ng-webpack
ko init-ng-webpack my-awesome-app
npm i
npm start
```

now you'll have a barebones ng 1.5+ w es6 on webpack app running

so have a cigar.

you also have the following commands

```
ko p app/route-component-name

ko s app/service-name
```

which will
- make themself
- add themself to the angular module dep of their owner


## coming soon:

ui-router integration with route-components

vanilla components

importing npm components
